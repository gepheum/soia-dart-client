name: Publish to pub.dev

# This workflow publishes the Dart package to pub.dev when a release is created
on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish to pub.dev
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # IMPORTANT: Before this workflow can work, you need to:
    # 1. Set up pub.dev publishing credentials:
    #    - Go to GitHub repo Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
    #    - Add a secret named PUB_DEV_PUBLISH_ACCESS_TOKEN
    #    - Get the token from: https://pub.dev/publishers (create a publisher if needed)
    #    - Or run 'dart pub token add https://pub.dev' locally and copy the token
    # 
    # 2. Make sure your pubspec.yaml has:
    #    - Correct version number (should match the release tag)
    #    - All required fields: name, description, version, homepage/repository
    #    - Valid SDK constraints
    #
    # 3. Ensure your package passes all pub.dev requirements:
    #    - Run 'dart pub publish --dry-run' locally first
    #    - Fix any warnings or errors before creating the release
